**README: 0x01 - Python - if/else, loops, functions**

### Project Description
This project focuses on learning Python basics related to conditional statements (`if/else`), loops, and functions. The project also delves into fundamental concepts such as indentation, variable assignments, and Python-specific functions and structures.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the fundamental principles of Python programming.
2. Learn about indentation's importance in Python.
3. Implement conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`), comments, and variable assignments.
4. Master the use of `while` and `for` loops.
5. Differentiate Python's `for` from that in C.
6. Utilize `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses in loops.
7. Understand the role and usage of the `pass` statement.
8. Work with Python's `range`.
9. Learn how to define and use functions.
10. Grasp the concept of returning a function that doesn't use a return statement.
11. Comprehend variable scopes and tracebacks.
12. Apply arithmetic operators and understand their usage.

### Requirements
1. Python Scripts
    - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
    - Interpreter: `python3` (version 3.8.5) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
    - Files must end with a newline character.
    - All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
    - A mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project directory.
    - Code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
    - All files should be executable.
    - Code length will be evaluated using `wc`.

2. C Scripts (for specific tasks)
    - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
    - Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`.
    - Files must end with a newline character.
    - Compiled using `gcc` options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
    - `main.c` files are provided for task tests.
    - The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named `lists.h`.
    - Header files should have include guards.

### Tasks
The project consists of multiple tasks involving Python scripts and a task in C scripting:
1. Determine if a randomly generated number is positive or negative.
2. Print the last digit of a randomly generated number.
3. Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
4. Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
5. Print numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format.
6. Print all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. Check if a character is lowercase.
8. Print a string in uppercase.
9. Print the last digit of a number.
10. Add two integers and return the result.
11. Compute a number to the power of another number.
12. Print numbers from 1 to 100 with conditions applied (FizzBuzz).
13. Insert a number into a sorted singly linked list (C scripting).
14. Print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
15. Remove a character from a string at a given index.
16. Recreate a Python function based on provided bytecode instructions.
