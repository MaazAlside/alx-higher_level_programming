# 0x00. Python - Hello, World, Resources

This project serves as an introduction to Python programming, covering the basics and providing resources for learning. You'll create and run Python scripts, get acquainted with the Python interpreter, and learn essential Python concepts.

## Key Objectives
By the end of this project, you should understand the following:

- The significance of Python programming.
- Who created Python and why it's called "Python."
- The Zen of Python.
- How to use the Python interpreter.
- Basic Python syntax for printing text and using strings.
- Indexing and slicing in Python.
- Python coding style and code checking with pycodestyle.

## Requirements

**Python Scripts**
- You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- All your scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of your scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- You must have a `README.md` file at the root of your repository.
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style.
- All your Python files must be executable.
- Your script lengths will be checked using `wc`.

**Shell Scripts**
- You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Each shell script should be exactly two lines long.
- Files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all shell scripts should be `#!/bin/bash`.
- All your files must be executable.

**C Scripts**
- You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your C files should end with a new line.
- Code should follow the Betty style and will be checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No use of global variables is allowed.
- Each file can contain no more than 5 functions.
- Function prototypes should be included in your `lists.h` header file.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- Use include guards in your header files.
