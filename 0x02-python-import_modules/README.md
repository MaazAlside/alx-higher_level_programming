This project involves learning and applying various concepts related to Python programming, including modules and imports. The README file provides an overview of the project's learning objectives, requirements, and tasks. Here's a summary of the contents without the details:

## Project Title: Python - Import & Modules

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Learn how to import functions from another file.
- Discover how to use imported functions.
- Explore how to create a module.
- Learn how to use the built-in function `dir()`.
- Understand how to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported.
- Explore how to use command-line arguments with your Python programs.

### Requirements
- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A mandatory README.md file should be present at the root of the project folder.
- Code should adhere to the pycodestyle (PEP 8) style guide.
- All files must be executable.

### Tasks
1. Import a simple function from a simple file:
   - Write a program that imports the `add` function from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. My first toolbox!:
   - Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

3. How to make a script dynamic!:
   - Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

4. Infinite addition:
   - Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.

5. Who are you?:
   - Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

6. Everything can be imported:
   - Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

7. Build my own calculator! (Advanced):
   - Write a program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations.

8. Easy print (Advanced):
   - Write a program that prints `#pythoniscool` in the standard output.

9. ByteCode -> Python #3 (Advanced):
   - Write a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that performs the same operations as a given Python bytecode.

10. Fast alphabet (Advanced):
    - Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase in a compact manner.

Please note that for some tasks, advanced Python knowledge and creative solutions are required.
